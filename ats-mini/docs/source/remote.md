# Remote control

Remote control has two parts:

* **Transport** - the connection used to reach the receiver.
* **Protocol** - the set of commands or button events carried over that connection.

The receiver currently supports two transports: **USB Serial** and **Bluetooth Low Energy**. It also supports two protocols: the **Ad hoc protocol** and the **Bluetooth HID protocol**.

## Transports

### USB Serial

Enable `Settings -> USB Port -> Ad hoc` to use USB Serial with the ad hoc protocol.

Use [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) or Picocom to connect to the serial port. Alternatively, open the following web terminal in Google Chrome: <https://www.serialterminal.com/>.
[ESP32 documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v5.0/esp32/get-started/establish-serial-connection.html#verify-serial-connection) notes that the default serial settings are 115200 8N1, though 9600 8N1 may be a bit more reliable.

### Bluetooth LE

Enable `Settings -> Bluetooth` to use Bluetooth LE in one of these modes:

* **Ad hoc** - uses the same remote-control protocol as USB Serial, but over BLE.
* **HID** - lets the receiver connect to supported Bluetooth remotes and keyboards.

Bluetooth support is experimental and may be unstable.

#### Local serial port over BLE

If you prefer using a normal local serial port, you can bridge the receiver's BLE Ad hoc mode to one with the [ble-serial](https://github.com/Jakeler/ble-serial/) utility.

First install `uv` <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/>

The following example commands are primarily for **Linux** and **macOS**:

1. Enable `Settings -> Bluetooth -> Ad hoc` on the receiver.
2. Scan for the receiver over BLE:

```shell
uv tool run --from ble-serial ble-scan -s 6E400001-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E
```

Example output:

```text
Started general BLE scan

XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX (rssi=-69): ATS-Mini

Finished general BLE scan
```

3. Start the bridge and replace the device id with the one from your scan result:

```shell
uv tool run --from ble-serial ble-serial -d XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
```

This creates a local serial port at `/tmp/ttyBLE`.

4. Open it with your terminal program:

```shell
picocom /tmp/ttyBLE -b115200
```

You can then use the same ad hoc commands documented below, but through the BLE-backed local serial port instead of USB serial.

On Windows this usually takes a few extra steps to expose the BLE link as a usable COM port. See the [ble-serial](https://github.com/Jakeler/ble-serial/) project for platform-specific details.

## Protocols

### Ad hoc protocol

The ad hoc protocol is the main remote-control protocol. It can be used over:

* **USB Serial**
* **Bluetooth LE** in `Settings -> Bluetooth -> Ad hoc` mode

#### Monitor output

The following comma separated information is sent out when the monitor (log) mode is enabled:

In SSB mode, the "Display" frequency (Hz) = (currentFrequency x 1000) + currentBFO

#### Making screenshots

The screenshot function is intended for interface and theme designers, as well as for the documentation writers. It dumps the screen to the remote console as a BMP image in HEX format. To convert it to an image file, you need to convert the HEX string to binary format.

A quick one-liner for macOS and Linux over the **USB Serial** transport (change the `/dev/cu.usbmodem14401` serial port name as needed):

```shell
echo -n C | socat stdio /dev/cu.usbmodem14401,echo=0,raw | xxd -r -p > /tmp/screenshot.bmp
```

### Bluetooth HID protocol

The Bluetooth HID protocol is available only over **Bluetooth LE** in `Settings -> Bluetooth -> HID` mode.

In this mode the receiver looks for supported BLE HID devices and maps their key events to receiver actions. A list of supported devices is available in [Accessories: Bluetooth LE input devices](accessories.md#bluetooth-le-input-devices). At the moment, support is limited to the specific HID devices recognized by the firmware.

#### Key bindings

| Bluetooth HID key event | Receiver action               | Comments                                                        |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Volume Increment        | Rotate encoder up             | Same effect as turning the encoder clockwise                    |
| Volume Decrement        | Rotate encoder down           | Same effect as turning the encoder counter-clockwise            |
| Next Track              | Press and rotate encoder up   | Uses the receiver's press-and-rotate gesture                    |
| Previous Track          | Press and rotate encoder down | Uses the receiver's press-and-rotate gesture                    |
| Play/Pause single click | Encoder click                 |                                                                 |
| Play/Pause double click | Encoder short press           | Only available on devices that do not report the click duration |
| Play/Pause short press  | Encoder short press           | Only available on devices that report the click duration        |

The press-and-rotate mapping is useful for actions that already depend on that gesture, such as direct frequency input mode and fine tuning in Seek mode.
