# User Manual

## Main screen

![](_static/screenshot-main.png)

* **RSSI meter** (top left corner), also serves as a mono/stereo indicator in FM mode (one/two rows).
* **Settings save icon** (right after the RSSI meter). The settings are saved to non-volatile memory after 10 seconds of inactivity.
* **Bluetooth icon** (right after the save icon). Different colors indicate the connection status.
* **Wi-Fi icon** (top right area near the battery). Different colors indicate the connection status.
* **Battery status** (top right corner). It doesn't show the voltage when charged, see [#36](https://github.com/esp32-si4732/ats-mini/issues/36#issuecomment-2778356143). The only indication that the battery is charging is the hardware LED on the bottom of the receiver, which turns ON during charging.
* **Band name and modulation** (VHF & FM, top center). See the [Bands table](#bands-table) for more details.
* **Info panel** (the box on the left side), also **Menu**. The parameters are explained in the [Menu](#menu) section. Also it can show the current time, or the date and time after a successful synchronization.
* **Frequency** (center of the screen).
* **FM station name** (RDS PS) or **frequency name** (right below the frequency). A frequency name appears for some popular frequencies like FT8, SSTV, CB channels, or a shortwave [schedule](#schedule). Can also display current **menu option** using a bigger font when the Zoom Menu setting is enabled.
* **Tuning scale** (bottom of the screen). Can be replaced with additional RDS fields (RT, PTY) when extended RDS is enabled, or RSSI/SNR graphs in Scan mode.

## Alternative UI

![](_static/screenshot-smeter.png)

The differences are:

* **Stereo indicator** is on the right side of the band and mode (VHF & FM).
* **Tuning scale** (right under the station name). Numbers on the left & right sides are the band limits.
* **S/N Meter** (in dB). The range is 0...127 and the visual indicator linearly displays this range.
* **RSSI & S-Meter** (the number is in dBµV, the meter is in S-points). Please note that the RSSI range is also 0...127 (no negative values) and according to [these tables](https://dl4zao.de/_downloads/Dezibel.pdf) any values below S4 on HF (rssi < 4) and below S7 on VHF (rssi < 2) are bogus. Thus it is very far from being precise, and also depends on the antenna impedance.

Both meters can be replaced with additional RDS fields (RT, PTY) when extended RDS is enabled, or RSSI/SNR graphs in Scan mode.

## Controls

Controls are implemented through the encoder knob:

| Gesture                | Result                                                                |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Rotate                 | Tunes frequency, navigates menu, adjusts parameters.                  |
| Click (<0.5 sec)       | Opens menu, selects.                                                  |
| Short press (>0.5 sec) | Volume shortcut in VFO mode, context-dependent action in other modes. |
| Long press (>2 sec)    | Sleep on/off.                                                         |
| Press and rotate       | Direct frequency input mode, fine tuning in Seek mode.                |

### Direct frequency input mode

* Press and rotate the encoder to select the step (digit or "half-digit").
* Rotate the encoder to adjust the frequency.
* Use short press to align frequency to the current step.
* To exit the mode, click the encoder or wait for a couple of seconds.

## Menu

The menu can be invoked by clicking the encoder button and is closed automatically after a couple of seconds.

* **Mode** - FM (only available on the VHF band); LSB, USB, AM (available on other bands). The receiver doesn't support the NFM mode (on any band, including the CB) due to limitations of the SI4732 chip.
* **Band** - List of [Bands](#bands-table).
* **Volume** - 0 (silent) ... 63 (max). The headphone volume level can be low (compared to the built-in speaker) due to limitation of the initial hardware design. Use short press to mute/unmute.
* **Step** - Tuning step (not every step is available on every band and mode).
* **Seek** - Seek up or down on AM/FM, normal tuning on LSB/USB (hardware seek function is not supported by SI4732 on SSB). Rotate or click the encoder to stop the seek. Use short press to switch between the seek and [schedule](#schedule) modes. Use press and rotate for manual fine tuning.
* **Scan** - Scan a frequency range and plot the RSSI (S) and SNR (N) graphs (unfortunately, these metrics are almost meaningless in SSB modes due to SI4732 patch limitations). Both graphs are normalized to 0.0 - 1.0 range. While the Scan mode is active, short press the encoder for 0.5 seconds to rescan. To abort a running scan process click or rotate the encoder.
* **Memory** - 99 slots to store favorite frequencies. Short press (>0.5 sec) on an empty slot to store the current frequency, short press to erase a slot, switch between stored slots by rotating the encoder, click to exit the menu. It is also possible to edit the memory slots via [remote control](remote.md) or via the [web based tool](memory.md) in Google Chrome.
* **Squelch** - mute the speaker when the selected RSSI (dBuV) or SNR (dB) level is lower than the defined threshold. The setting is saved separately for each mode (FM, LSB, USB, AM). When Off, short press the encoder button to switch between RSSI and SNR. When enabled, short press turns squelch Off. Unlikely to work in SSB mode.
* **Bandwidth** - Selects the bandwidth of the channel filter.
* **AGC/ATTN** - Automatic Gain Control (on/off) or Attenuation level. The attenuator is not applicable to SSB mode.
* **AVC** - Sets the maximum gain for automatic volume control (not applicable to FM mode).
* **SoftMute** - Sets softmute max attenuation (only applicable to AM/SSB).
* **Settings** - Settings submenu.

## Settings menu

* **Brightness** - Display brightness level (10...255). The minimal one draws about 80mA of the battery power, the default one about 100mA, the max level about 120mA.
* **Calibration** - SSB calibration offset (-2000...2000, per mode/band).
* **RDS** - Radio Data System options: PS - radio station name, CT - date and time, RT - text, PTY - genre, ALL (EU/US) - everything. RDS CT should contain UTC date and time, but some stations incorrectly transmit local or completely bogus values. The clock is synchronized from RDS only once. To synchronize it again, disable and re-enable RDS CT or switch the receiver off and on.
* **UTC Offset** - Affects the displayed date and time. Please note that automatic DST transitions are not supported; the offset needs to be adjusted manually.
* **Date/Time** - Set the UTC date and time with the encoder. Click to select the next field, or short press to set the clock and close the menu. A timeout closes the menu without changing the clock.
* **FM Region** - FM de-emphasis time constant by region (50µs for EU/JP/AU and 70µs for the US).
* **Theme** - Color theme.
* **UI Layout** - Alternative UI layouts. For now there is just one alternative UI with large S-meter and S/N-meter.
* **Zoom Menu** - Display the currently selected menu item using a larger font (accessibility option).
* **Scroll Dir.** - Menu scroll direction for clockwise encoder turn.
* **Sleep** - Automatic sleep interval in seconds (0 - disabled).
* **Sleep Mode** - Locked - lock the encoder rotation during sleep; Unlocked - allow tuning the frequency in sleep mode; CPU Sleep - the maximum power saving mode. With the display being on, default brightness, and Wi-Fi the power consumption is about 170mA, without Wi-Fi 100mA, Locked/Unlocked modes draw about 70mA, CPU sleep mode draws about 40mA.
* **Load EiBi** - download the EiBi [schedule](#schedule) (requires Wi-Fi internet connection).
* **USB Port** - USB serial mode: Off (default) or Ad hoc. In Ad hoc mode, the receiver accepts the [remote control](remote.md) commands over the USB serial port.
* **Bluetooth** - Bluetooth LE mode: Off (default), Ad hoc, or HID. Ad hoc exposes the same [remote control](remote.md) protocol over BLE. HID makes the receiver act as a BLE HID central and connect to supported Bluetooth remotes/keyboards so their buttons can control tuning and menu actions. WARNING: it is not recommended to enable both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi at the same time (the receiver might become unstable).
* **Wi-Fi** - Wi-Fi mode: Off (default), Access Point, Access Point + Connect, Connect, Sync Only. More details on that below.
* **About** - Informational screens (Help, Authors, System).

## Wi-Fi

The Wi-Fi mode (2.4GHz only) can be used for the following purposes (for now):

* Time synchronization via NTP (Network Time Protocol) or the configuration web page.
* Download the EiBi shortwave schedule.
* Viewing the receiver status (date/time and UTC offset, frequency, RSSI/SNR, volume, battery voltage, etc).
* Viewing the Memory slots with saved frequencies.
* Manage the receiver settings.
* Upload or delete an optional splash image shown when the receiver starts.

There are a couple of modes:

* **Off** (default)
* **AP Only** - Access Point mode. The receiver creates its own access point called `ATS-Mini` and starts the web server on <http://10.1.1.1>.
* **AP+Connect** - Access Point mode + try to connect to one of the three configured access points. If the connection succeeds, the receiver will synchronize the time every 5 minutes and start the web server on both <http://10.1.1.1> and a dynamic IP address it got from the configured access point.
* **Connect** - try to connect to one of the three configured access points, start the web server on a dynamic IP, then synchronize the time every 5 minutes.
* **Sync Only** - same as Connect, but Wi-Fi will be disabled after a successful time synchronization.

Initial configuration:

* Enable the **AP Only** mode (the receiver will briefly display its 10.1.1.1 IP address).
* Connect to the `ATS-Mini` access point from your phone or computer. There is no internet connection available on this access point. When connecting from a phone, it might be necessary to switch off the mobile data connection and any VPN/firewall software.
* Open a browser and visit the following URL: <http://10.1.1.1>. The status web page should open. Alternatively, you can try the mDNS address <atsmini.local> in your browser.
* Click the `Config` link. Here you can configure up to three access points the receiver will try to connect to, add optional login and password to protect the settings page, set the UTC date/time manually or from the browser, and change the UTC offset and other settings. Enable `Scan Hidden SSIDs` only if one of the configured access points does not broadcast its network name; leaving it off makes Wi-Fi connection faster.
* After that, switch the Wi-Fi mode to **AP+Connect** or **Connect** (the receiver will briefly show its new dynamic IP address it got from a configured access point).
* Now connect your phone/computer to the same access point and open the new URL to check whether the receiver connected to the internet.

From now on you can switch the modes as you want and connect to your receiver either via the `ATS-Mini` internal access point (if enabled, mostly useful when there are no access points around), or via an external access point and a dynamic IP address. The receiver will always listen on the mDNS address <atsmini.local>.

```{hint}
When on the go, you can set up a mobile Wi-Fi hotspot on your smartphone and use it to connect the receiver to the internet.
```

<!-- ### Receiver settings available via Wi-Fi only -->

## Schedule

The receiver can download the [EiBi](http://eibispace.de/dx/eibi.txt) shortwave schedule and use it to display broadcasting stations, allowing you to quickly tune to them. Here’s how it works:

* The schedule only needs to be downloaded once via [Wi-Fi](#wi-fi). It will be stored in the receiver's flash memory so it doesn't need to be fetched every time the device powers on.
* To display scheduled stations correctly, the receiver’s clock must be set. You can set the UTC date/time from the Settings menu or the configuration web page, or configure a Wi-Fi internet connection and use Sync Only mode for NTP synchronization. The UTC offset setting doesn’t affect the schedule. A less reliable alternative is to use RDS CT, but this requires finding a station that broadcasts UTC time (not local time).
* Once set up, the receiver will display station names currently broadcasting on specific frequencies (only scheduled times are considered; days of the week are ignored for now).
* You can quickly jump between stations using the Seek mode (marked by a clock icon). To switch between modes, short press the encoder while in Seek mode.

## Reset

To reset the receiver settings (current band, frequency, favorite stations, downloaded schedule, etc):

1. Switch off the receiver
2. Press and hold the encoder
3. Turn on the receiver
4. Release the encoder after the `Resetting Preferences` message appears
